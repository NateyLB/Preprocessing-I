              <h1>About</h1>
              <p>Born in San Francisco, California. I have lived in the Bay Area most of my life. 
                I went to high school in Fremont, California and briefly went to high school in Mesa, Arizona.
                I took a 4 year hiatus from school after high school to discover what career path I wanted
                to pursue. In that time I worked as quality assurance at Tesla, a medical device assembler at Olympus Medical,
                and a coating technician at a small specialized silicon chip coating company. Not finding any of this work fulfilling,
                I wanted to go back to school. While taking general education classes at community college, I decided to take an intro to C++ class.
                I loved it, I wanted to pursue Computer Science fully. I have fulfilled all the requirements for transfer and I am enrolled in San Francisco
                State University. Wanting to expedite the hiring process, I have decided to take a 9 month bootcamp at Lambda while I wait for university to start at SFSU.</p>

            <h1>Work History</h1>
            <div>
            <p>My first non service sector job out of highschool was at Tesla motors, I started on the production line and after a while moved up to quality assurance where I did final inspection on components.</p>
			<p>After Tesla, I began work in the manufacturing sector again. I was a medical device production associate at Olympus Medical. I assembled very intricate endoscopes and also refurbished older models</p>
		    <p>My last manufacturing job was at Specialized Coating Services, where I worked multiple jobs around the warehouse such as shipping & recieving, deliveries, and general manufacturing processes.</p>
            <p>Currently, I drive Uber in San Francisco because it is the most flexible with my school schedule. I hope to be working in Technology by the start of 2021.</p>
